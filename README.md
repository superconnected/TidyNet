TidyNet
=======

A copy of the original TidyNet project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidynet/) with some tweaks for my own needs.

This version has been updated for Visual Studio 2012, added an option to remove empty tags, and added a convenience method to input a string and get a Tidied string out directly.
